## CooldownMaster

Unlimited profiles for the Blizzard Cooldown Manager. Save, organize, and share your CDM layouts across all characters.

---

### The Problem

Blizzard's Cooldown Manager limits you to 5 layouts per character with no way to share them between characters, back them up, or organize them by class/spec.

### The Solution

CooldownMaster adds a full profile and template system on top of the built-in Cooldown Manager:

**Global Profiles**
Create account-wide profiles that store layouts organized by class. Load any profile onto any character — CooldownMaster automatically applies the right layouts for your current class. One profile can hold layouts for every class, so your entire UI setup lives in one place.

**Template Library**
Save individual layouts into a reusable template library. Organize by class and spec, then add templates to any profile. Perfect for keeping your best layouts ready to use.

**Full Import / Export**
Share your entire profile, a single class setup, or an individual layout with friends. Supports:
- Full profile export (all classes)
- Per-class export
- Individual layout export
- Raw CDM string import
- Smart conflict resolution (copy or overwrite when names collide)

**Sync with Blizzard**
- **Sync from Blizzard**: Capture your current in-game layouts into a profile with one click
- **Load to Blizzard**: Push profile layouts back into the Cooldown Manager instantly

**Quality of Life**
- Auto-switch profiles on spec change
- Minimap button (left-click to open, right-click for settings)
- Resizable three-column UI
- Inline rename and delete on every row
- Works alongside the native Cooldown Manager — doesn't replace it
